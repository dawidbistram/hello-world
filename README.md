so I strated a course for front-end-development organized by google with udacity
and thats the reason i am here 
some dreams and projects to develop a
walk in the forest of life 
with the sense of knowing litlle 
being able to transform what is left of my days on earth in to sculpture humane shape
i recomend h7 by exceeed http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5

and works by syberian colllective quite <<http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=7522&order=release>>
to see what are my aspirations in this field
so  plese share any suggestion on where to go with my atention
